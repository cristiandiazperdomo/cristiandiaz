# Hi, I'm Cristian Díaz :sparkles:

I'm a programmer focused on front-end!

When I was 18 years old I took a course at [Jóvenes a Programar](https://jovenesaprogramar.edu.uy/), where I learned many technologies such as HTML, CSS and JS. 

Today's market is very competitive, so I needed to learn a lot of other things. For that I am a React apprentice. I made a project that you can see here [Weather-App](https://weather-53907.web.app/). I have projects where I made a small Back-End to E-commerce, Contablito and Contact-List.

I am currently improving my Front-End skills. Building Projects with React and learning English to go to level B2.

I like to play the guitar, exercise and read books.
